Some of the core functionality of this project is implemented in BcdiCore.jl and BcdiTrad.jl. Additionally, this package is part of a collection of BCDI packages consisting of BcdiAtomic.jl (an atomic scale BCDI solver), BcdiMeso.jl (a mesoscale BCDI Solver), and BcdiMulti.jl (a multiscale BCDI solver).","category":"page"},{"location":"main/","page":"BcdiStrain","title":"BcdiStrain","text":"While this package is marked as BCDI specific, the methods are more general and can be used in many phase retrieval problems.

","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"BCDI","title":"BCDI","text":"BcdiCore.jl implements all of the Fourier transforms for the Julia BCDI packages. In addition, BcdiCore calculates the loss function used (either L_2 or the MLE estimator) and derivatives of these loss functions.\nBcdiTrad.jl implements projection-based BCDI algorithm. Currently, this is limited to ER, HIO, and shrinkwrap. \nBcdiStrain.jl implements a multi-peak BCDI algorithm developed by the BYU-CXI group. In addition to the alogrithms present in BcdiTrad, BcdiStrain also implements Mount, an operator that switches between peaks.\nBcdiMeso.jl implements a BCDI algorithm that solves in the mesoscale regime. Instead of using projections, this algorithm uses a gradient-based optimization scheme. Additionally, BcdiMeso does not assume a small measurement distance away from the peak.\nBcdiAtomic.jl is an upcoming BCDI package that implements a BCDI algorithm that solves at the atomic scale.\nBcdiMulti.jl is an upcoming BCDI package that implements a multiscale BCDI algorithm that solves at both the mesoscale and the atomic scale.\nBcdiSimulate.jl is an upcoming BCDI package that simulates the BCDI problem. Currently, this is only implimented at the atomic scale.","category":"page"},{"location":"use/#Overview","page":"Usage","title":"Overview","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"use/","page":"Usage","title":"Usage","text":"BcdiStrain implements projection-based algorithms in operator-style format.
